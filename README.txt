When i first got my arduino kit and looked through the components I knew I wanted
to make a simple videogame once i got to the joystick. It brought me back to middle
school when my bestfriend was into programming and I made the art for a game he 
was making and I always wanted to do one myself.

I intended to replicate my favourite game from my first cellphone, snake. I used to
play this game for hours and would fill the whole screen up and in the future I 
would like to buy a display and 3D print a casing so I can have a standalone version
of the snake game. In the future I could also flesh out the interface more and add
settings such as colour custimization and altering the games size and scale within
the interface.
